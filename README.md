# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

HTML CSS Git Challenge, or Module 1's Challenge, is to refactor existing code for a company. The marketing agency is looking for a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their site is optimized for search engines. This will be accomplished by adding semantic HTML elements, providing logical structure to the code, adding accesible alt attributes, and creating a concise, descriptive title. This challenge will test our ability to utilize git flow, edit code, and make live an existing HTML.
